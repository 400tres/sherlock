# Sherlock: Browser Fingerprint-Based Authentication System

## Overview
Sherlock allows users to log in to websites without typing their passwords.

Sherlock utilizes the browser fingerprinting technique implemented by [fingerprintjs2](https://github.com/Valve/fingerprintjs2) to identify users' devices.

Sherlock's benefits have been tested and backed up by our research.

## Features
- Secure and usable password-free authentication
- Provide the service provider control over levels of confidence for user authentication
- No setup requirements from users
- Allow user to register multiple device fingerprints for each account
